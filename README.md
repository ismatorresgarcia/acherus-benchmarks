# Acherus Benchmarks Repository

📁 This `benchmarks` folder contains the most important results obtained using the `Acherus` code. 

- 🌐 Check the source repository at https://github.com/ismatorresgarcia/acherus

🎯 The goal is to track and organize the latest updates between successful numerical simulations by visually comparing images from articles with our processed results. To put it simply, the objective is to maintain a simple record of how the results from our computational models are evolving, enabling comparisons with both experimental data and other simulation approaches."

### What is Acherus
📦 `Acherus` is a 3D spatiotemporal code that solves the PDE's for ultraintense and ultrashort laser pulses propagating though optically transparent media using a Finite-Difference Scheme (FDS) numerical method. It computes the laser's electric field envelope and plasma generated electron density from a given space-time Gaussian initial profile. It is capable of simulating gaseous, liquid and condensed media for axially symmetric scenarios where modulational instabilities won't break the beam into multiple filaments.

### What It Does:
- 🌱 **Tracking Progress**: It catalogs, in a systemic manner, the latest outputs and findings from simulations.
  
- 🧪 **Comparison with Experiments**: It provides a space within the repository to compare simulation results against real-world experimental data, allowing for the validation of the models.
  
### Why It’s Important:
- ✨ **Refinement**: It helps assess, enhance and expand our understanding of physical phenomena involved in filamentation processes. It also aids in improving model accuracy and addressing any shortcomings in predictions.
  
- 🧠 **Insight and Cross-Validation**: It tracks and documents simulations, highlights discrepancies, and future improvements, aiding decision-making for future simulations.
  
- 💞️ **Collaboration**: It facilitates collaboration by inviting researchers to share their thoughts, enabling collective improvements and generating new insights that may not have been considered in previous step.
