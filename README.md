# Benchmarks

"This `benchmarks` folder contains the most important results obtained using some of the codes from the main `phd_coding` directory, which will also be located in this folder. The goal is to track and organize the latest updates between successful numerical simulations by visually comparing images from articles with our processed results. To put it simply, the objective is to maintain a simple record of how the results from our computational models are evolving, enabling comparisons with both experimental data and other simulation approaches."

### What It Does:
- **Tracking Progress**: It catalogs, in a systemic manner, the latest outputs and findings from simulations.
  
- **Comparison with Experiments**: It provides a space within the repository to compare simulation results against real-world experimental data, allowing for the validation of the models.
  
### Why Itâ€™s Important:

- **Refinement**: It helps assess, enhance and expand our understanding of physical phenomena involved in filamentation processes. It also aids in improving model accuracy and addressing any shortcomings in predictions.
  
- **Insight and Cross-Validation**: It tracks and documents simulations, highlights discrepancies, and future improvements, aiding decision-making for future simulations.
  
- **Collaboration**: It facilitates collaboration by inviting researchers to share their thoughts, enabling collective improvements and generating new insights that may not have been considered in previous step.
